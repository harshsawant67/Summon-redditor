# 🧠 Summon Redditor

**A sarcastic web game where fake Reddit users battle for meaningless glory.**

Summon randomized Reddit personas, each crafted with absurd usernames and imaginary stats. Watch them battle for clout, cringe, and karma in a completely ridiculous browser-based arena.

---

## 🎯 Inspiration

Reddit is full of strong opinions, stranger usernames, and overconfidence. We thought: what if we turned that chaos into a turn-based internet gladiator game? Thus, Summon Redditor was born — a parody game that turns Reddit culture into interactive fun.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

- **Summon Random Redditors:** Fake users with random names, karma scores, upvote power, and cringe levels.
- **Battle Arena:** Two users enter, one exits victorious (based on logic we control).
- **Leaderboard:** Keeps track of past winners during the session.
- **Stat-Based Combat:** Cringe decreases power, karma increases it. It’s dumb, but fun.
- **No Login Required:** Just click and go. Built to be used anonymously.
